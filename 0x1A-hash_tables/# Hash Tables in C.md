 # Hash Tables in C

## Introduction
Hash tables are a data structure that stores key-value pairs in a way that allows fast retrieval of values based on the key. They are implemented using an array of linked lists, where each linked list stores the key-value pairs for a particular hash value.

## Implementation Details
The code provided implements a hash table in C using the djb2 hash function. The hash function takes a key and returns a hash value, which is then used to determine the index of the linked list in the array where the key-value pair will be stored.

The `hash_table_set` function is used to set a value in the hash table. It first calculates the hash value of the key and then searches the linked list at that index for the key. If the key is found, the value is updated. If the key is not found, a new node is created and added to the linked list.

The following code snippet shows how to use the `hash_table_set` function:

```c
#include "hash_tables.h"

int main() {
  // Create a hash table with a size of 10.
  hash_table_t *ht = hash_table_create(10);

  // Set a value in the hash table.
  hash_table_set(ht, "key", "value");

  // Get a value from the hash table.
  char *value = hash_table_get(ht, "key");

  // Print the value.
  printf("%s\n", value);

  // Free the hash table.
  hash_table_destroy(ht);

  return 0;
}
```

## Conclusion
Hash tables are a powerful data structure that can be used to store and retrieve data efficiently. The code provided implements a hash table in C using the djb2 hash function. The `hash_table_set` function is used to set a value in the hash table, and the `hash_table_get` function is used to get a value from the hash table.
